# loopy
An infrastructure for music information retrieval focusing on electronic music, especially for data synthesis and annotation. Our home page is [here](https://loopy4edm.com/). The paper is now under review by an ACM venue. Essential components of this project (presets, samples) are available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X-jArl_6DsBxZdXGL7wzgaVI4m6f8wiy)

## Important facts

1. To maintain the quality of sounds, we use high sample rate 44100 instead of 22050.
2. For the same reason, we recommend using stereo wave (2D np.ndarray) instead of mono wave (1D).
